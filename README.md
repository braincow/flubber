# Flubber

Hi, I am Flubber. Your friendly time management utility and a companion for wonderful TailorDev/Watson time tracker. My purpose is not to replace Watson, but to bring those features you need most often to nice Gtk+ GUI and leave the power of Watson still available to you via its command line.

## Installation

Currently I am lacking fully functional setup.py deployment, "Some assembly required". So I am recommending that if you would like to test me please clone the repository and through Makefile magic prepare my Python virtual environment.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/braincow/flubber.git
$ make env
```

## Usage

To run me properly since my installation is still a bit lagging is also trough my Makefile.

```
$ make run
```

## Support

Please open an issue to receive support. Please be mindful that this is currently just only a hobby and learning project so help might never come.

## Contributing

Fork the project, create a new branch, make your changes, and open a pull request.
